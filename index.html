            <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange
                wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized
                database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional
                coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form
                (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use
                decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is
                minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered
                centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed
                ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized
                cryptocurrency.Since the release of bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been created.

                <h2>What Is Bitcoin Mining?</h2>

                <p>Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation, but it is also a
                    critical component of the maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger. It is performed
                    using very sophisticated computers that solve extremely complex computational math problems.
                    Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding. Nonetheless,
                    mining has a magnetic appeal for many investors interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact
                    that miners are rewarded for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial
                    types see mining as pennies from heaven, like California gold prospectors in 1849. And if you are
                    technologically inclined, why not do it? However, before you invest the time and equipment, read
                    this explainer to see whether mining is really for you.</p>

                <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>By mining, you can earn cryptocurrency without having to put down money for it.</li>
                    <li>Bitcoin miners receive Bitcoin as a reward for completing "blocks" of verified transactions,
                        which are added to the blockchain.</li>
                    <li>Mining rewards are paid to the miner who discovers a solution to a complex hashing puzzle first,
                        and the probability that a participant will be the one to discover the solution is related to
                        the
                        portion of the total mining power on the network.</li>
                    <li>You need either a GPU (graphics processing unit) or an application-specific integrated circuit
                        (ASIC) in order to set up a mining rig.</li>
                </ul>
