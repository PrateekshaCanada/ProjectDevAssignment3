            <h2>Bitcoin</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Bitcoin is considered the original crypto, and its launch in 2009 is what started the whole
                    cryptocurrency movement. Bitcoin - and the blockchain technology on which it operates - was invented
                    by an individual or group of individuals operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was
                    put forward as an alternative to the fiat monetary system. The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has
                    never been revealed.</p>
                <p>In the Bitcoin whitepaper, Nakamoto argued that a fiat monetary system controlled by central banks
                    and a small number of financial institutions led to a centralised wealth and power and made social
                    and financial mobility difficult. Ordinary people’s savings were eroded through inflation, largely
                    as a result of central bank’s money printing.</p>
                <p>Bitcoin solved that problem by fixing the number of units ever issued, thereby preventing inflation
                    caused by money printing. Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer blockchain technology meant it didn’t need
                    financial institutions to facilitate transactions and verify ownership.</p>
                <p>Bitcoin is still by far the most popular cryptocurrency and its price movement has a strong impact on
                    the rest of the crypto market.</p>
